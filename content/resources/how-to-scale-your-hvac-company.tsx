      <p>
        Scaling isn’t about doing more work — it’s about designing a business
        that works without you holding everything together manually.
      </p>

      <h2>The three stages of an HVAC business</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Owner-operator: you ARE the business.</li>
        <li>Owner + techs: you’re half in the field, half in the office.</li>
        <li>Systems-driven: the business runs on processes, not you.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Systems required before scaling</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Lead capture & response</li>
        <li>Scheduling & dispatch</li>
        <li>Estimates & follow-up</li>
        <li>Customer communication pipelines</li>
        <li>Job documentation & invoicing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where AI fits in</h2>

      <p>
        AI removes repetitive mental work. Combine clean processes with smart
        automation, and your business becomes easier to run as it grows — not
        harder.
      </p>

      <h2>Your role as the business grows</h2>

      <p>
        Scaling isn’t just revenue — it’s building a company that supports your
        life instead of consuming it.
